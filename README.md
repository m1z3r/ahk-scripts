This folder contains a small list of AutoHotKey scripts which assist in skilling tasks in OSRS. I should say, AutoHotKey usage is technically a bannable offense, however its usage is in a grey area as far as TOS is concerned. I believe they banned AHK because people could basically use it for macroing/botting, however very simple scripts such as this, are using 1:1 input and only improve the experience. I believe these scripts to be purely for QoL purposes and do not condone botting in OSRS.

ahk.ahk is useful for simple stuff like withdrawing 14 of each item from your bank, with 2 rows of separating between them. I use a dual 1920x1080p with 2 x 23" Monitors for reference.

ahk2-stretched-mode-variant is for use with RuneLites stretched mode with the RuneLite client maximized.
